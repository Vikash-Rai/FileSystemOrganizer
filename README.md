FSO [file System organizer] is a program that is basically 
used to organize your unorganized files within directory of a system.

for example when we download things such as of archives,media,documents,photos etc to the same location [directory] 
then everything gets messed up, which generally don't looks good in system.
So for these , a program is written to manange each specific files to that particular folder..

List of all the commands:
        node main.js organize "dirPath"
        node main.js help
